              "'targets were the overriding criteria for judging investments \\nand leaders. Significantly, the bonuses of senior R&D exec-\\nutives are based on companywide performance numbers \\nrather than the costs of or revenue from particular products. \\nThus product decisions are somewhat insulated from short-\\nterm financial pressures. The finance team is not involved in \\nthe product road map meetings of engineering teams, and \\nengineering teams are not involved in pricing decisions.\\nWe don’t mean to suggest that Apple doesn’t consider \\ncosts and revenue goals when deciding which technologies \\nand features the company will pursue. It does, but in ways \\nthat differ from those employed by conventionally organized \\ncompanies. Instead of using overall cost and price targets as \\nfixed parameters within which to make design and engineer-\\ning choices, R&D leaders are expected to weigh the benefits \\nto users of those choices against cost considerations.\\nIn a functional organization, individual and team repu-\\ntations act as a control mechanism in placing bets. A case in \\npoint is the decision to introduce the dual-lens camera with \\nportrait mode in the iPhone 7 Plus in 2016. It was a big wager \\nthat the camera’s impact on users would be sufficiently great \\nto justify its significant cost.\\nOne executive told us that Paul Hubel, a senior leader \\nwho played a central role in the portrait mode effort, was \\n“out over his skis, ” meaning that he and his team were taking \\na big risk: If users were unwilling to pay a premium for a \\nphone with a more costly and better camera, the team would \\nmost likely have less credibility the next time it proposed an \\nexpensive upgrade or feature. The camera turned out to be a \\ndefining feature for the iPhone 7 Plus, and its success further \\nenhanced the reputations of Hubel and his team.\\nIt’s easier to get the balance right between an attention to \\ncosts and the value added to the user experience when the \\nleaders making decisions are those with deep expertise in \\ntheir areas rather than general managers being held account-\\nable primarily for meeting numerical targets. Whereas the \\nfundamental principle of a conventional business unit struc-\\nture is to align accountability and control, the fundamental \\nprinciple of a functional organization is to align expertise and \\ndecision rights.\\nThus the link between how Apple is organized and \\nthe type of innovations it produces is clear. As Chandler \\nfamously argued, “structure follows strategy”—even though \\nApple doesn’t use the structure that he anticipated large \\nmultinationals would adopt.\\nNow let’s turn to the leadership model underlying Apple’s \\nstructure.\\nTHREE LEADERSHIP CHARACTERISTICS\\nEver since Steve Jobs implemented the functional organi-\\nzation, Apple’s managers at every level, from senior vice \\npresident on down, have been expected to possess three key \\nleadership characteristics: deep expertise that allows them \\nto meaningfully engage in all the work being done within \\ntheir individual functions; immersion in the details of those \\nfunctions; and a willingness to collaboratively debate other \\nfunctions during collective decision-making. When manag-\\ners have these attri\\n but\\nes, decisions are made in a coordinated \\nfashion by the people most qualified to make them.\\nDeep expertise. Apple is not a company where general \\nmanagers oversee managers; rather, it is a company where \\nexperts lead experts. The assumption is that it’s easier to \\ntrain an expert to manage well than to train a manager to be \\nan expert. At Apple, hardware experts manage hardware, \\nsoftware experts software, and so on. (Deviations from \\nthis principle are rare.) This approach cascades down all \\nlevels of the organization through areas of ever-\\n inc\\nreasing \\n2019\\nDESIGN\\nOPERATIONS\\nSALES\\nHARDWARE  \\nENGINEERING\\nRETAIL\\nPEOPLE\\nSOFTWARE\\nFINANCE\\nSERVICES\\nLEGAL\\nMACHINE LEARNING & AI\\nCORPORATE COMM.\\nHARDWARE\\nSOFTWARE\\nMARKETING\\nOPERATIONS\\nSERVICES & SUPPORT\\nSALES\\nFINANCE\\nLEGAL\\nMARKETING\\nENVIRONMENT,  \\nPOLICY & SOCIAL\\nHARDWARE  \\nTECHNOLOGIES\\nMARKETING COMM.\\nCORPORATE DEV.\\nCEO\\nApple’s Functional Organization\\nIn 1997, when Steve Jobs returned to Apple, it had a conventional structure for its size and scope. It was divided into business units, each with \\nits own P&L responsibilities. After retaking the helm, Jobs put the entire company under one P&L and combined the disparate departments of \\nthe business units into one functional organization that aligns expertise with decision rights—a structure Apple retains to this day.\\nCEO1998\\n6\\nHarvard Business Review\\nNovember–December 2020\\nThis article is made available to you with compliments of Apple Inc for your personal use.

              "'the answer (because they don’t). This differs starkly from \\nthe way leaders question subordinates about activities in the \\nowning and teaching boxes.\\nFinally, Rosner has delegated some areas—including \\niMovie and GarageBand, in which he is not an expert—to \\npeople with the requisite capabilities. For activities in the \\ndelegating box, he assembles teams, agrees on objectives, \\nmonitors and reviews prog ress, and holds the teams account-\\nable: the stuff of general management.\\nWhereas Apple’s VPs spend most of their time in the own-\\ning and learning boxes, general managers at other companies \\ntend to spend most of their time in the delegating box. Rosner \\nestimates that he spends about 40% of his time on activities \\nhe owns (including collaboration with others in a given area), \\nabout 30% on learning, about 15% on teaching, and about 15% \\non delegating. These numbers vary by manager, of course, \\ndepending on their business and the needs at a given time.\\nThe discretionary leadership model preserves the funda-\\nmental principle of an effective functional organization at \\nscale—aligning expertise and decision rights. Apple can \\neffectively move into new areas when leaders like Rosner \\ntake on new responsibilities outside their original expertise, \\nand teams can grow in size when leaders teach others their \\ncraft and delegate work. We believe that Apple will continue \\nto innovate and prosper by being organized this way.\\nAPPLE’S FUNCTIONAL ORGANIZATION is rare, if not unique, \\namong very large companies. It flies in the face of prevailing \\nmanagement theory that companies should be reorganized \\ninto divisions and business units as they become large. But \\nsomething vital gets lost in a shift to business units: the \\nalignment of decision rights with expertise.\\nWhy do companies so often cling to having general man-\\nagers in charge of business units? One reason, we believe, \\nis that making the change is difficult. It entails overcoming \\ninertia, reallocating power among managers, changing an \\nindividual- oriented incentive system, and learning new ways \\nof collaborating. That is daunting when a company already \\nfaces huge external challenges. An intermediate step may be \\nto cultivate the experts-leading-experts model even within'"

That involves not only developing \\nentirely new product categories such as the iPhone and the \\nApple Watch, but also continually innovating within those \\ncategories. Perhaps no product feature better reflects Apple’s \\ncommitment to continuous innovation than the iPhone cam-\\nera. When the iPhone was introduced, in 2007, Steve Jobs \\ndevoted only six seconds to its camera in the annual keynote \\nevent for unveiling new products. Since then iPhone camera \\ntechnology has contributed to the photography industry \\nwith a stream of innovations: High dynamic range imaging \\n(2010), panorama photos (2012), True Tone flash (2013), opti-\\ncal image stabilization (2015), the dual-lens camera (2016), \\nportrait mode (2016), portrait lighting (2017), and night mode \\n(2019) are but a few of the improvements.\\nTo create such innovations, Apple relies on a structure \\nthat centers on functional expertise. Its fundamental belief \\nis that those with the most expertise and experience in a \\ndomain should have decision rights for that domain. This \\nis based on two views: First, Apple competes in markets \\nwhere the rates of technological change and disruption are \\nhigh, so it must rely on the judgment and intuition of people \\nwith deep knowledge of the technologies responsible for \\ndisruption. Long before it can get market feedback and solid \\nmarket forecasts, the company must make bets about which \\ntechnologies and designs are likely to succeed in smart-\\nphones, computers, and so on. Relying on technical experts \\nrather than general managers increases the odds that those \\nbets will pay off.\\nSecond, Apple’s commitment to offer the best possible \\nproducts would be undercut if short-term profit and cost \\nABOUT THE ART\\nApple Park, Apple’s corporate headquarters in  \\nCupertino, California, opened in 2017.\\nMikael Jansson/Trunk Archive\\nFOR ARTICLE REPRINTS CALL 800-988-0886 OR 617-783-7500, OR VISIT HBR.ORG\\nHarvard Business Review\\nNovember–December 2020 \\u20095'),\n",

Much less well known are the organizational \\ndesign and the associated leadership model that have played \\na crucial role in the company’s innovation success.\\nWhen Jobs arrived back at Apple, it had a conventional \\nstructure for a company of its size and scope. It was divided \\ninto business units, each with its own P&L responsibilities. \\nGeneral managers ran the Macintosh products group, the \\ninformation appliances division, and the server products \\ndivision, among others. As is often the case with decentral-\\nized business units, managers were inclined to fight with \\none another, over transfer prices in particular. Believing that \\nconventional management had stifled innovation, Jobs, in \\nhis first year returning as CEO, laid off the general managers \\nof all the business units (in a single day), put the entire com-\\npany under one P&L, and combined the disparate functional \\ndepartments of the business units into one functional organi-\\nzation.

As \\nwas the case with Jobs before him, CEO Tim Cook occupies the \\nonly position on the organizational chart where the design, \\nengineering, operations, marketing, and retail of any of Apple’s \\nmain products meet. In effect, besides the CEO, the company \\noperates with no conventional general managers: people \\nwho control an entire process from product development \\nthrough sales and are judged according to a P&L statement.\\nBusiness history and organizational theory make the case \\nthat as entrepreneurial firms grow large and complex, they'),\n",

So they charged the algorithm \\nteams with achieving the same effect.

The camera team \\nhad designed the feature so that users could see its effect on \\ntheir photos only after they had been taken, but the human \\ninterface (HI) design team pushed back, insisting that users \\nshould be able to see a “live preview” and get some guidance \\nabout how to make adjustments before taking the photo. \\nJohnnie Manzari, a member of the HI team, gave the camera \\nteam a demo. “When we saw the demo, we realized that this \\nis what we needed to do, ” Townsend told us.

It proved a major reason for \\nusers’ choosing to buy and delighting in the use of the phone.\\nAs this example shows, Apple’s collaborative debate \\ninvolves people from various functions who disagree, push \\nback, promote or reject ideas, and build on one another’s \\nideas to come up with the best solutions. It requires open-\\n \\nmindedness fr\\nom senior leaders. It also requires those \\nleaders to inspire, prod, or influence colleagues in other  \\nareas to contribute toward achieving their goals.\\nWhile Townsend is accountable for how great the camera \\nis, he needed dozens of other teams—each of which had a \\nlong list of its own commitments—to contribute their time and \\neffort to the portrait mode proj\\n ect.

The answer is collaborative \\ndebate. Because no function is responsible for a product or a \\nservice on its own, cross-functional collaboration is crucial.\\nWhen debates reach an impasse, as some inevitably do, \\nhigher-level managers weigh in as tiebreakers, including at \\ntimes the CEO and the senior VPs. To do this at speed with \\nsufficient attention to detail is challenging for even the best \\nof leaders, making it all the more important that the company \\nfill many senior positions from within the ranks of its VPs, \\nwho have experience in Apple’s way of operating.\\nHowever, given Apple’s size and scope, even the executive \\nteam can resolve only a limited number of stalemates. The \\nmany horizontal dependencies mean that ineffective peer \\nrelationships at the VP and director levels have the potential \\nto undermine not only particular proj\\n ec\\nts but the entire \\ncompany. Consequently, for people to attain and remain in \\na leadership position within a function, they must be highly \\neffective collaborators.\\nThat doesn’t mean people can’t express their points of \\nview. Leaders are expected to hold strong, well-grounded \\nviews and advocate forcefully for them, yet also be willing  \\nto change their minds when presented with evidence \\nthat others’ views are better. Doing so is not always \\neasy, of course. A leader’s ability to be both partisan and \\nopen-minded is facilitated by two things: deep understand-\\ning of and devotion to the company’s values and common \\npurpose, and a commitment to separating how right from \\nhow hard a particular path is so that the difficulty of execut-\\ning a decision doesn’t prevent its being selected.\\nThe development of the iPhone’s portrait mode illustrates \\na fanatical attention to detail at the leadership level, intense \\ncollaborative debate among teams, and the power of a shared \\npurpose to shape and ultimately resolve debates. In 2009 \\nHubel had the idea of developing an iPhone feature that \\nwould allow people to take portrait photos with bokeh—'),\n",
